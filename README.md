Project compares pH levels between northern and southern hemispheres of the Atlantic Ocean between 1/10/2015 and 5/1/2017.
All data gathered from OOI data portal, specifically from Global Argentine Basin station and Global Irminger Sea Station.
pH data is gathered from a depth of approximately 30m.
Data is averaged by approximate month.

Data analysis is performed comparing the monthly average pH level in the two locations against one another.

A significant portion of the program is dedicated to formatting the data for approachable graphing. This is reflected in the program comments.

I'd like to revisit this project in the future and include other types of measurement data in an attempt to determine the driving factors of the pH change seen at the Global Argentine Basin station
