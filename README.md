Project compares pH levels between northern and southern hemispheres of the Atlantic Ocean between 1/10/2015 and 5/1/2017.
All data gathered from OOI data portal, specifically from Global Argentine Basin station and Global Irminger Sea Station.
pH data is gathered from a depth of approximately 30m.
Data analysis is performed comparing the pH levels in the two locations against one another.

Global Irminger Sea Source: https://ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/data_access/?search=GI03FLMB-RIS01-04-PHSENF000#GI03FLMB-RIS01-04-PHSENF000/phsen_abcdef_instrument 

I may return to this project in the future and add more data in an attempt to determine the driving factors of the pH change seen at the Global Argentine Basin station.
